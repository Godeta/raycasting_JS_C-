# raycasting_JS_Cpp
A project in which I try to resume what is raycasting, how does it work and make some implementations in C++ and Javascript.

### Structure
There is a simple documentation in the folder "doc_theory", a C++ project making some 3D raycasting in the folder "raycastCpp" and some JS examples of Raycasting using the library p5.js in the folder "raycastJS".
